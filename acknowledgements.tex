\chapter{Acknowledgements}

That is quite a long way to get to this place, and another journey in my life
is about to start. First of all, I'd like to thank my family for giving me the
best of they could. Second, I'd like to thank each people in the SQLab and
NCTUCSCC for companying and helping me with all the professional stuff. Third,
it has been quite a difficult time for Taiwan and all over the world. Sunflower
movement, serveral airplane crashes, Kaohsiung gas explosion, etc. Here's a
snippet from Heal The World --- Michael jackson

Heal the world\newline
Make it a better place\newline
For you and for me and the entire human race\newline
There are people dying\newline
If you care enough for the living\newline
Make a better place for you and for me\newline

Finally, one last thing for myself, a famous quote from Steve Jobs' commencement
address at Stanford 2005

``Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.''
